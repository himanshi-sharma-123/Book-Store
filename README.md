## Book Store

Welcome to Book Store, an E-Book Management System tailored for bookstores of small to 
medium sizes. This system streamlines bookstore operations by enabling sellers to add 
new books, images and reference materials using a computerized interface. 

## About

Incorporating modules for book inventory, this system facilitates tracking of available 
books and customer profiles. By utilizing this computerized setup, it mitigates the risk of 
losing book or customer records, a common occurrence in non-computerized systems.

## Future Scope

Expanding the website's future scope involves transforming it into a comprehensive hub, 
consolidating the best book prices from various sources into a singular platform. This evolution 
aims to simplify users' experiences by eliminating the need to navigate multiple websites or 
platforms when buying or selling books. By centralizing book transactions, the website becomes 
an all-in-one destination for users, offering a seamless and convenient marketplace for purchasing 
and selling books at the best available prices.
